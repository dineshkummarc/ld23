					<h1>Wibblymat's Ludum Dare #23 Entry page</h1>
					<p>This page is a place to keep all of my information about <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/about-ludum-dare/">Ludum Dare</a> 23 together.</p>
					<p>All of the interesting stuff can be found at the links on the left.</p>
					<p>Since the competition hasn't started yet, there isn't a great deal to see.</p>
					<p>The game is/will be HTML5 canvas/javascript. Development will happen in Chrome, so it is possible that it will only work in Chrome for others. Hopefully not!</p>
					<p>I won't be using an existing game framework, though since I'm using jquery and bootstrap for this site I might possibly use them for the game too. Other tools in my toolbox are The GIMP, Inkscape, Audacity, Sublime Text 2, git, Dropbox, imagemagick and lots of pens and paper!</p>

						<p>Decided to get plenty of sleep before the event, so went to bed super early and got up at 5am - 3 hours after the theme announcement.</p>
						<p>Even though "Tiny World" was not one of the themes I had planned for ahead of time I was immediately inspired. I think the aesthetic idea I've had is pretty great - and simple to do - but I'm not yet sure of my gameplay. I have an idea for that too, its just a little boring. I'll give it half an hour and if I haven't thought of anything else I'll just go for it!</p>

						<p>LD23 is a little more than a day away now, and it's time for some last minute preparation. I've mostly got things set up in terms of the website and the blog, and I got my dev environment sorted out earlier in the week.</p>
						<p>It's a long time (8 years?) since I last seriously attempted a game at all and even back then I was only doing very small things. I think I could easily knock out in 48 hours anything that I completed back then.</p>
						<p>Fortunately, I'm not completely rusty. I code for a living and recently I've been doing a lot of work in HTML5 canvas which has been good preparation. And since I decided to enter LD23 I've spent many hours thinking about, playing and designing games. Hopefully this will help me quickly see how to turn the theme into a game!</p>
						<p>For the last week or so I've been speccing out a particular game that I was thinking I could shoe-horn into whatever theme comes up, but I've decided to just go with the flow and see what comes out. I can always make my other game afterwards!.</p>
						<p>Anyway, good luck to anyone else who is taking part, and have fun.</p>
